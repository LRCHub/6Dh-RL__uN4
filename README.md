[00:01.62] I don't like you, T-Series
[00:04.52] Nothing personal, kid
[00:07.58] But I must go all out
[00:10.28] Just this once
[00:17.28] 
[00:12.90] Bobs or vegana, whichever will it be?
[00:15.80] Sit the fuck down, T-Series, I'm here to spill the real tea
[00:19.36] You tryna dethrone me from spot on number one
[00:22.03] But you India, you lose, so best think you haven't won
[00:25.56] When I'm through with you, we're gonna be completely fuckin' done
[00:28.52] 'Cause we only just begun
[00:30.15] I review you, zero, bye bitch, gone
[00:32.65] So come on, T-Series, looking hungry for some drama
[00:36.08] Here, let me serve you bitch lasagna
[00:54.08] 
[00:38.48] Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
[00:41.66] T-Series ain't nothing, but a bitch lasagna
[00:44.87] Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
[00:48.16] Look at T-Series, they just crying for their momma
[00:51.32] Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
[00:54.51] T-Series ain't nothing, but a bitch lasagna
[00:57.75] Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
[01:00.94] T-Series just wet themselves in their pyjamas
[01:23.44] 
[01:03.98] So who the hell is Bob and why you wanna kiss him? (Ew)
[01:07.15] I'm a blue eyes white dragon while you're just dark magician (oof)
[01:10.40] You got a fifth of the population in your nation but
[01:13.52] I got nine-year-olds of worlds so hold your defecation (oops)
[01:16.78] Motu-Patlu, what the fuck is that even supposed to mean?
[01:19.94] Your language sounds like it came from a mumble-rap community
[01:23.28] No, papa, no, papa, yes, papa, Johnny
[01:26.45] Now down a load of sugar and let's throw this fucking party with some...
[02:02.45] 
[01:29.63] Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
[01:32.87] Look at T-Series, they just crying for their momma
[01:36.07] Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
[01:39.05] T-Series ain't nothing, but a bitch lasagna
[01:42.46] Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
[01:45.66] Look at T-Series, they just wettin' their pyjama
[01:48.85] Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
[01:52.16] T-Series ain't nothing, but a bitch lasagna
[02:13.66] 
[01:55.32] You got a population of one point three-two billion
[02:01.59] But most your videos can't seem to get even a million
[02:07.93] Sub-bot!
